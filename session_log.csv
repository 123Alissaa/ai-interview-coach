It was kinda hard, and I didn’t like some of my team",2,4,2,2,-0.2916666666666667," Great job sharing an example of a time when you worked in a team setting! To make your answer even stronger, consider adding more context and detail about the specific role you played as a leader in this project, what the project entailed, and any challenges or successes you faced.

Additionally, it's important to show that you learned and grew from the experience. Reflecting on the aspects of your team that you didn't like can be an opportunity to demonstrate self-awareness and flexibility in working with others. For example, you could discuss how you navigated those difficult situations or what steps you took to improve communication within your group.

Overall, focus on highlighting your leadership skills and the valuable lessons you learned from collaborating with a diverse team. Good luck!"
